                    If you are enjoying this project and would like to support me, 
                    to cover the costs of renting a server and buying a domain...<br/>
                    Feel free to do whatever you like, because I am not going to place a PayPal link on this site!

                    This is a OSRS fan-made project, which lets you have some fun. <br/>
                    Grab yourself a random gear setup, a random monster and a random inventory. <br/> 
                    Hop into the real game and have some fun!

                            The creator of <a href="https://www.osrsbox.com/">OSRSBox</a>
                            , the one and only <a href="https://www.thomaslaurenson.com/">Thomas Laurenson</a>. 
                            He is the man, who created some databases and APIs, which contain tons of OSRS related stuff.
                            To name a few, then these would be all OSRS monsters, all OSRS items and all OSRS prayers.<br/>

                            I, the creator of OSRS Randomizer, would like to thank him. Without his OSRSBox project,
                            this project would not have been possible.
